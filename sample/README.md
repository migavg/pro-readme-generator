## Description 

Pizza is good but it’s way better with pineapple on it. This app helps spread the word and opinion on how pineapple does belong on a pizza especially if it is paired up with ham. Unless you are allergic to pineapple don’t use this app. 


## Installation

Using supercomputers that are neuro linked to different sized pineapples and a 12 volt battery you can download and unzip this mega app. 

## Usage

The usage of this app is mainly used to locate pizza restaurants near you and inform them that every pizza they make should have pineapple as a topping.

## Contribution

There weren't many contributions to this app initially since unfortunately some people don’t like pineapple on their pizza. But give them time they’ll come around and when they inevitably do, I will list them as contributors. 


## Test

This Super app needs no test since we have the power of the best tropical pineapples powering it.
