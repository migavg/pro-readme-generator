# Pro README Generator

## Description

This week‚Äôs challenge was to create a README generator that creates a professional looking README by using Node inside a terminal.

Using Node v16.8.0, the integrated terminal in VS Code and JavaScript I created a useful README generator that structures a markdown file by the input that is typed into the terminal. 

This particular application seemed complex in the beginning due to node being a new technology that I have not used before along with new syntax that I am still currently learning more about. 

I received insightful tips and resources from different peers in my cohort and luckily by collaborating with them I managed to build a functional README generator. 

I‚Äôm sure that there are certain lines of my code that can be immensely condensed but I am happy nonetheless on how this challenge turned out and will look into how to shorten it.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
